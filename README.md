# Retail-Analytics-Project
## Introduction:
Retail analytics is the practice of monitoring company information, including inventory levels, consumer behavior, sales figures, and more, in order to make more strategic, educated decisions. This involves offering information to comprehend and improve the retail business's operational procedures, sales patterns, consumer behavior, and overall performance. Due to the high standards that consumers have for retail today, businesses must satisfy these growing demands with tailored omnichannel offers, effective procedures, and prompt adaptations to emerging trendsâ€”all of which call for retail analytics. On Statista's Amazon quarterly revenue, this is clearly visible. The fourth quarter of the year always sees Amazon's highest quarterly revenue, suggesting that consumers spend more money in this period than in the others. This is obvious given that Black Friday and Christmas both fall within the fourth quarter, which also sees a huge increase in global consumption. Potential sales would be lost if a store had too few items before Christmas. However, if a store has too many items, too much storage will be needed, and since storage costs money, the business will once again lose money. Therefore, RDA can be applied to try and improve product production so that there is always an ideal amount available.

## Data Exploration
The DataSet was got from kaggle here [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset?select=stores+data-set.csv]
We have historical sales information for 45 stores spread across several geographies, each of which has a number of departments. The business also holds a number of annual promotional discount events. The Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are the four biggest holidays that these markdowns coincide with. In comparison to non-holiday weeks, the evaluation of the weeks that include certain holidays is weighted five times more heavily.
The Dataset consist of three csv files
1. Store Dataset: This contains Anonymized information about the 45 stores, indicating the type and size of store
2. Feature Dataset: Contains additional data related to the store, department, and regional activity for the given dates.
3. Sales Dataset: This contains Historical sales data, which covers to 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01.
